    <h1>Different Classes of food.</h1>
    <section id="carb">
        <h2>Carbonhydrates</h2>
        <p>Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose.</p>
        <p>Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Starches</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Fibre</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="prot">
        <h2>Protein</h2>
        <p>A protein is a naturally occurring, extremely complex substance that consists of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds.</p>
        <p>Proteins are present in all living organisms and include many essential biological compounds such as enzymes, hormones, and antibodies.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chicken and turkey</li>
            <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
            <li>Beans and pulses</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="fat">
        <h2>Fat</h2>
        <P>Fats are nutrients in food that the body uses to build cell membranes, nerve tissue (including the brain), and hormones.</P>
        <P>The body also uses fat as fuel. If fats eaten aren't burned as energy or used as building blocks, they're stored by the body in fat cells.</P>
        <ol>
            <li>butter, ghee, and lard</li>
            <li>cheese, especially hard cheese like cheddar</li>
            <li>biscuits, cakes, and pastries</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="vit">
        <h2>Vitamins</h2>
        <p>Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients required by the body to carry out a range of normal functions. However, these micronutrients are not produced in our bodies and must be derived from the food we eat. </p>
        <p>Vitamins are organic substances that are generally classified as either fat soluble or water soluble.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>fresh and dried fruit</li>
            <li>wholegrain breads</li>
            <li>meat and fish</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="min">
        <h2>Minerals</h2>
        <p>A mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic element or compound having an orderly internal structure and characteristic chemical composition, crystal form, and physical properties. </p>
        <p>Common minerals include quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, olivine, and calcite.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>cereals</li>
            <li>fruit</li>
            <li>bread</li>
